# Javadoc Formatter
A small script to reformat JavaDoc on UW-Madison CS course website into directly usable Java class.
# Usage
Python 2.7 is required to run this script.

<pre><code>python [script] [address of javadoc]
</code></pre>

The script will generate a .java file under the same directory, converted from the website.
# Examples
This is a currently active javadoc from Program 2 of CS 302 Fall 2015:
<pre><code>http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/programs/p2/javadoc/GameOfLife.html
</code></pre>
It could be used to test the script as its argument. The script should generate a GameOfLife.java as in the example folder.
